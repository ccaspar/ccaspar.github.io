                    <p>I am a recent graduate of General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course. The program teaches a comprehensive end to end approach to the data science process using python, from data gathering and munging to modeling to presenting and defending your findings. I have hands on experience with many different modeling techniques, such as linear and logistic regression, bagging and boosting models, neural networks with Tensorflow/Keras, and unsupervised learning methods too. Previously in my career, I trained as a financial analyst in the Chartered Financial Analyst program. Data science allows me to combine my analytical mindset with my interest in programming and machine learning. Take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/ccaspar/"> github </a> to see some of my work!</p>

                    <p>I believe that data is critical to a well functioning business; with the right application it is incredibly powerful. So much data is generated by us, the users. I am interested in how data can teach us more about ourselves, and what we can learn from it to improve efficiency in day to day operations.</p>
