                    <p>I am a data scientist in training, currently in General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course (concluding in April). To this point in my career, I have trained as a financial analyst in the Chartered Financial Analyst program. Data science allows me to combine my analytical mindeset with my interest in programming and machine learning.</p>

                    <p>I'm all about big data! It's fascinating, right? With the right application it is incredibly powerful. In the end, much of this data is generated by us, the users. I am interested in seeing how data teaches us more about ourselves.</p>
