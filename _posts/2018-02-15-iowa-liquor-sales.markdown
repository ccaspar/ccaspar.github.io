description: <b>Overview</b><br>Iowa liquor sales! This report provides an analysis of transactional data and demographic data to predict total sales by liquor stores in Iowa. The goal was to use this info to make locational recommendations for building new liquor stores in Iowa. I combined liquor data with demographic data to test if demographic data could predict total store sales. For this study, I used linear regression to model sales because I wanted to infer about the relations between my variables and my target. In this instance, I want to find the optimal demographic measures and then locate the areas with the best combinations of these features.<br><br><b>Data</b><br>The data was sourced from the state of Iowa, and was grouped into store level data in order to infer about sales by store. Two datasets were used: Iowa liquor transactions, and Iowa demographic data.<ul><li>Iowa liquor transactions:<br>Provided by the state of Iowa, consists of every class E liquor transaction in Iowa from January 2015 to March 2016. Data includes store info and address, liquor type and quantity, and cost to store and buyer.</li><br><li>Iowa demographic data:<br>Pulled from the Iowa State Data Center, a combination of demographic data organized by county. Data was pulled from the 'American Community Survey' section of the ISDC's website.</li></ul>
