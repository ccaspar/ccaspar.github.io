description: This project is an exercise in nerual network implementation using TensorFlow and Keras. I used the MNIST data set to train feed forward and convolutional neural networks using Tensorflow and Keras. The goal was to characterize each digit into a digit 0-9. This was an excellent primer on the difference in implementation between Tensorflow and Keras.
