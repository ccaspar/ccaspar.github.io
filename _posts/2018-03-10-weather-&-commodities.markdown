description: While in college, I took a weather and climate course. I've always carried an interest in nature and the environment, and that course allowed me to appreciate these things from a new perspective. Since then I've been curious about the link between commodities and the weather. Now I finally had the opportunity to examine it in depth! The goal of this study is to examine the effect of weather on agricultural commodity prices. Specifically, can we use recent weather to predict prices in the near future? Corn, cotton, and wheat are three of the US' biggest crops. The hypothesis is that weather will affect the supply of these commodities when they hit the market in the near future. For example, a particularly dry spell, or wildfires, could reduce the supply of corn that is currently being harvested and will hit the market in a couple weeks. This reduced supply would then drive prices up. I will use US spot prices and US weather data. This analysis assumes that the US market is the driver of US commodity prices; as three of the US largest crops, they certainly have a large effect on domestic prices. However, it is certainly possible that imports from other countries would affect prices too.<br><br><b>Data</b><br>Two main datasets were used. <br><br>&#8212 First is historical price data for corn, cotton, and wheat. This data is a daily price for every business day dating back to the 60s. There are data points for every trading day (no weekends or holidays) which on average is 252 days per year. There was very little clearning required for this data. Data was retreived from http://www.macrotrends.net/charts/commodities <br><br>
